## Features

- OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/speech`
- Reference voices from files, multiple waveform or latent clips, `voices.json`, or HTTP upload
- Caption-based Voice Design and Speaker Inversion
- Up to 120 seconds of combined reference audio with v4 Small
- Response formats: `wav`, `mp3`, `flac`, `opus`, `aac`, `pcm`
- Automatic long text chunking
- Per-request dynamic LoRA adapter loading
- Optional bearer token auth

## Requirements

For local Python:

- Python 3.10
- uv
- FFmpeg for compressed audio formats

For Docker:

- Docker Engine with Docker Compose, or Docker Desktop
- NVIDIA Container Toolkit or Docker Desktop GPU support for CUDA inference
- ROCm-capable Docker host for AMD GPU inference

A CUDA or ROCm GPU is recommended for practical inference.

## Installation

```bash
git clone -b aarch64 https://github.com/tinatsu-nomy/Irodori-TTS-Server.git
cd Irodori-TTS-Server

uv sync --extra cu130
cp .env.example .env
```

Choose one PyTorch backend extra:

```bash
uv sync --extra cu130  # NVIDIA DGX Spark / GB10
uv sync --extra cu128  # NVIDIA CUDA 12.8
uv sync --extra rocm   # AMD ROCm on Linux
uv sync --extra cpu    # CPU-only
```

The PyTorch backend extras are mutually exclusive. The `cu128` extra uses the PyTorch CUDA 12.8 index, the `rocm` extra uses the PyTorch ROCm index on Linux, and the `cpu` extra uses the CPU PyTorch index on Linux/Windows.

After syncing with a backend extra, use `uv run --no-sync ...` for the commands
below to avoid re-syncing the environment without the selected PyTorch backend
extra.

By default, the server downloads [`Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4-Small`](https://huggingface.co/Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4-Small) and its bundled tokenizer from Hugging Face when the model is first loaded. To use a local checkpoint, set:

```bash
IRODORI_CHECKPOINT=/path/to/model.safetensors
```

`IRODORI_HF_CHECKPOINT` also accepts a checkpoint subfolder inside a Hugging Face repo:

```bash
IRODORI_HF_CHECKPOINT=Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4-Small-Quantized/int8-weight-only
```

For local v4 checkpoints, keep the exported `tokenizer/` directory next to
`model.safetensors`, or at the parent level when checkpoints are organized into
variant subfolders. Older checkpoints without bundled tokenizer assets continue
to use the tokenizer repository recorded in their checkpoint metadata.

For MeanFlow inference, set:

```bash
IRODORI_HF_CHECKPOINT=Aratako/Irodori-TTS-v4.1-Small-MF
```

The runtime selects the MeanFlow sampler automatically. Leave
`IRODORI_DEFAULT_NUM_STEPS` unset to use the model default (RF: 40, MeanFlow: 4).
If an existing `.env` sets it to `40`, remove or comment out that line to enable
the model default. Request-level `num_steps` overrides the server default.
Inference-time CFG and Sway Sampling settings are ignored for MeanFlow checkpoints.

## Running

```bash
uv run --no-sync python -m irodori_openai_tts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8088
```

This uses the PyTorch backend selected during `uv sync`.

Open the health endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/health
```

## Docker

Create `.env` first:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set the backend used when the image is built. On the `aarch64` branch,
`cu130` is the validated default for Linux/aarch64 CUDA 13:

```env
IRODORI_TTS_BACKEND=cu130
```

Available values are `cu130`, `cu128`, `rocm`, and `cpu`.
Only `cu130` has been validated on Linux/aarch64 in this branch.

On the first run, or after updating the server code, build and recreate the container:

```bash
docker compose up --build --force-recreate
```

After that, start the existing image normally:

```bash
docker compose up
```

For NVIDIA GPU settings, build and recreate with both Compose files:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.gpu.yaml up --build --force-recreate
```

Then use this for normal GPU startup:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.gpu.yaml up
```

For AMD ROCm, set `IRODORI_TTS_BACKEND=rocm` in `.env`, then build and recreate with the ROCm Compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.rocm.yaml up --build --force-recreate
```

Then use this for normal ROCm startup:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yaml -f compose.rocm.yaml up
```

For CPU-only Docker images, set `IRODORI_TTS_BACKEND=cpu` in `.env` before building.

Reference voices placed in `./voices` are available inside the container. Downloaded Hugging Face files are kept in a Docker volume so they are reused across container recreations.

## Quick Usage

Put a reference voice in `voices/`. Files can be added before or after the server starts; the directory is scanned when a request resolves a voice.

```text
voices/
  sample.wav
```

Then call the speech endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "irodori-tts",
    "input": "こんにちは。これはIrodori-TTSのAPIテストです。",
    "voice": "sample",
    "response_format": "wav"
  }' \
  --output speech.wav
```

Using the OpenAI Python SDK:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8088/v1",
    api_key="not-used",
)

with client.audio.speech.with_streaming_response.create(
    model="irodori-tts",
    voice="sample",
    input="こんにちは。これはIrodori-TTSのAPIテストです。",
    response_format="wav",
) as response:
    response.stream_to_file("speech.wav")
```

The SDK method name contains `streaming_response`, but this server still generates a complete response internally.

### Voice Design

Irodori-TTS-v4-Small supports both pure Voice Design without reference audio and
caption-controlled voice cloning.

For pure Voice Design, use the built-in `none` voice and describe the desired
voice and delivery with `irodori.caption`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "irodori-tts",
    "input": "本日はお越しいただき、ありがとうございます。",
    "voice": "none",
    "response_format": "wav",
    "irodori": {
      "caption": "落ち着いた低めの女性の声。丁寧で穏やかな話し方。"
    }
  }' \
  --output voice_design.wav
```

For caption-controlled voice cloning, specify both a registered reference voice
and a caption. The reference supplies the speaker identity while the caption
guides voice characteristics and delivery:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "irodori-tts",
    "input": "それでは、元気よく始めましょう！",
    "voice": "alice",
    "response_format": "wav",
    "irodori": {
      "caption": "明るく元気で、楽しそうな話し方。"
    }
  }' \
  --output styled_clone.wav
```

The `none` voice is available when `IRODORI_ALLOW_NO_REF_VOICE=true`, which is
enabled by default.

## API

### `GET /health`

Returns server status and current configuration. This endpoint does not load the model.

### `GET /v1/models`

Returns the model ID accepted by the speech endpoint.

Example response:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "irodori-tts",
      "object": "model",
      "created": 0,
      "owned_by": "irodori-tts"
    }
  ]
}
```

### `POST /v1/audio/speech`

Synthesizes speech and returns audio bytes.

Request fields:

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | string | yes | Use `irodori-tts` unless you changed `IRODORI_MODEL_NAME`. |
| `input` | string | yes | Text to synthesize. |
| `voice` | string or object | no | Voice ID, or `{ "id": "voice_id" }`. Uses `IRODORI_DEFAULT_VOICE` if omitted. |
| `response_format` | string | no | `wav`, `mp3`, `flac`, `opus`, `aac`, or `pcm`. |
| `speed` | number | no | Speaking speed, from `0.25` to `4.0`. Higher is faster; internally this is converted to an inverse duration scale. |
| `stream_format` | string | no | Set to `sse` to receive chunk-level Server-Sent Events. |
| `irodori` | object | no | Irodori-specific inference options. |

When `stream_format: "sse"` is set, the response is `text/event-stream`.
The server synthesizes each text chunk sequentially and emits one `audio_chunk`
event per chunk, followed by a final `done` event:

For consistent voice tone across chunks, specify a reference voice with `voice`,
`irodori.ref_wav`, or `irodori.ref_wavs`. Without a reference, each chunk is synthesized
independently and the perceived voice tone may vary between chunks.

```bash
curl -N http://localhost:8088/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -d '{
    "model": "irodori-tts",
    "input": "最初の文です。次の文です。",
    "voice": "sample",
    "response_format": "wav",
    "stream_format": "sse",
    "irodori": {
      "chunking_enabled": true,
      "chunk_min_chars": 1
    }
  }'
```

```text
event: audio_chunk
data: {"index":0,"text":"最初の文です。","format":"wav","media_type":"audio/wav","audio_base64":"...","seed":123,"total_to_decode":0.1}

event: audio_chunk
data: {"index":1,"text":"次の文です。","format":"wav","media_type":"audio/wav","audio_base64":"...","seed":123,"total_to_decode":0.1}

event: done
data: {"chunks":2}
```

Each `audio_base64` value contains a complete audio file for that chunk, so
clients can decode and enqueue chunks while later chunks are still generating.

Irodori-specific options:

```json
{
  "model": "irodori-tts",
  "input": "こんにちは。",
  "voice": "sample",
  "response_format": "wav",
  "speed": 1.1,
  "irodori": {
    "num_steps": 24,
    "cfg_scale_text": 3.0,
    "cfg_scale_speaker": 5.0,
    "lora_adapter": "/models/adapters/speaker-a",
    "seed": 1234,
    "t_schedule_mode": "sway",
    "sway_coeff": -1.0
  }
}
```

Common `irodori` options:

| Field | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `num_steps` | Sampling steps. Overrides `IRODORI_DEFAULT_NUM_STEPS`; if neither is set, uses the model default (RF: 40, MeanFlow: 4). |
| `seed` | Fixed random seed for reproducible output. |
| `cfg_scale_text` | Strength of text guidance. |
| `cfg_scale_speaker` | Strength of speaker/reference-voice guidance. |
| `lora_adapter` | PEFT LoRA adapter directory to load dynamically for this request. The adapter is not merged into the base checkpoint. |
| `t_schedule_mode` | Sampling schedule, usually `linear` or `sway`. |
| `sway_coeff` | Sway schedule coefficient when using `t_schedule_mode: "sway"`. |
| `chunking_enabled` | Enable or disable automatic long text chunking for this request. |
| `chunk_min_chars` | Minimum non-space characters before a chunk split point is used. |
| `first_sentence_chunk_min_chars` | Optional minimum non-space characters used only for splitting the first sentence. |
| `ref_wav` / `ref_latent` | One reference waveform or precomputed latent path. |
| `ref_wavs` / `ref_latents` | Ordered arrays of reference paths. The runtime concatenates them and applies the reference-duration limit. Do not combine singular and plural reference fields. |
| `max_ref_seconds` | Override the reference-duration limit. When omitted, v4 Small uses its checkpoint value of 120 seconds and legacy checkpoints fall back to 30 seconds. |
| `caption` | Voice/style description for caption-enabled VoiceDesign checkpoints. Ignored by checkpoints without caption conditioning. |
| `cfg_scale_caption` | Strength of caption guidance. |
| `max_caption_len` | Optional maximum caption token length. |

Dynamic LoRA loading is per runtime process. The first request for an adapter loads it into memory; later requests for the same adapter reuse the cached adapter. To run the base model after an adapter has been loaded, omit `lora_adapter` or set it to `null`, `"none"`, or `"base"`. Dynamic LoRA is not compatible with `IRODORI_COMPILE_MODEL=true`.

### Voice Management

The server scans `IRODORI_VOICES_DIR` for voice files. File stems become voice IDs.

Supported audio extensions:

- `.wav`
- `.flac`
- `.mp3`
- `.m4a`
- `.ogg`
- `.opus`
- `.aac`
- `.webm`

Latent references and Speaker Inversion are also supported:

- `.pt`
- `.pth`
- `.speaker.safetensors`

Examples:

```text
voices/
  alice.wav      -> voice: "alice"
  bob.flac       -> voice: "bob"
  cached.pt      -> voice: "cached"
```

Each file discovered this way becomes a separate voice. The server does not infer
that similarly named files belong to the same speaker.

Reference voices can be supplied in four ways:

| Method | Single reference | Multiple references | Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Place a file in `voices/` | yes | no | Persistent; the filename stem becomes the voice ID. |
| Voice upload API | yes | no | Persistent; each upload creates or replaces one voice file. |
| `voices/voices.json` alias | yes | yes | Persistent; use `ref_wavs` or `ref_latents` to group multiple files under one voice ID. |
| Request-level `irodori.ref_wav` / `irodori.ref_wavs` | yes | yes | One request only; no voice is registered. |

Paths passed directly in a request are resolved on the server, not on the client
machine. They must be local paths visible to the server process; HTTP URLs are not
accepted. With Docker, use paths visible inside the container. A remote client
that cannot provide a server-side path can upload a single reference and use the
resulting voice ID. Reusable multi-file groups still require a server-side
`voices.json` definition.

To register multiple clips as one persistent voice, create `voices/voices.json`:

```json
{
  "alice": "alice.wav",
  "bob": "bob_reference.flac",
  "cached": "cached.pt",
  "alice_long": {
    "ref_wavs": ["alice_01.wav", "alice_02.wav", "alice_03.wav"]
  }
}
```

Paths in `voices.json` are resolved relative to `IRODORI_VOICES_DIR`. Array entries
are processed in the order shown. The example above registers the three clips as
one voice named `alice_long`, which can then be used like any other voice:

```json
{
  "model": "irodori-tts",
  "input": "登録済みの複数参照音声を使用します。",
  "voice": "alice_long",
  "response_format": "wav"
}
```

The upload API accepts one file at a time and does not append clips to an existing
voice group. To create a reusable multi-clip voice, place or upload the individual
files and define their grouping in `voices.json`. For a one-off request that does
not need registration, pass the paths directly with `irodori.ref_wavs` or
`irodori.ref_latents` as described below.

Text-only inference is available with `voice: "none"` when `IRODORI_ALLOW_NO_REF_VOICE=true`.

Voice file endpoints:

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/v1/audio/voices` | List resolved voices. |
| `POST` | `/v1/audio/voices` | Upload voice file with multipart `file` and optional `voice_id`. |
| `GET` | `/v1/audio/voices/{voice_id}` | Get uploaded voice file metadata. |
| `PUT` | `/v1/audio/voices/{voice_id}` | Replace uploaded voice file. |
| `DELETE` | `/v1/audio/voices/{voice_id}` | Delete uploaded voice file. |

Upload example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8088/v1/audio/voices \
  -F voice_id=sample \
  -F file=@sample.wav
```

## Long Reference Audio

Irodori-TTS-v4-Small accepts up to 120 seconds of combined reference audio. Pass
multiple clips in input order with `irodori.ref_wavs`. These paths refer to files
visible to the server process, or to the container when running with Docker:

```json
{
  "model": "irodori-tts",
  "input": "複数の参照音声を使った音声合成です。",
  "irodori": {
    "ref_wavs": [
      "voices/speaker_01.wav",
      "voices/speaker_02.wav",
      "voices/speaker_03.wav"
    ]
  }
}
```

The clips are encoded separately, concatenated in the supplied order, and cut at
the checkpoint-specific reference limit. v4 Small was trained using concatenated
short clips, so multiple representative clips from the same speaker are the
recommended way to use the extended context. A single long recording is accepted,
but its behavior is less established because it does not match the primary
training construction.

`ref_latents` provides the equivalent ordered input for precomputed latent files.
Do not mix waveform and latent references, or singular and plural forms in the
same request. Set `irodori.max_ref_seconds` only when an explicit override is
needed; omitting it uses checkpoint metadata and preserves the 30-second fallback
for older checkpoints.

## Long Text Chunking

Long text chunking is enabled by default.

When enabled, the server splits text only when both conditions are met:

- the current chunk has at least `chunk_min_chars` non-space characters
- the current character is punctuation or a line break

Set `irodori.first_sentence_chunk_min_chars` to use a smaller threshold only
for the first sentence. Later sentences keep the normal `chunk_min_chars`
threshold.

Each chunk is synthesized sequentially, then concatenated into one audio response.

Per-request override:

```json
{
  "model": "irodori-tts",
  "input": "長い本文...",
  "voice": "sample",
  "response_format": "wav",
  "irodori": {
    "chunking_enabled": true,
    "chunk_min_chars": 80,
    "first_sentence_chunk_min_chars": 1
  }
}
```

If `irodori.seconds` is set, chunking is skipped because that fixed duration applies to the whole request.

## Request Queue

Only one synthesis request runs at a time by default. Additional requests wait for an available slot.

You can tune the queue with:

```env
IRODORI_MAX_CONCURRENT_SYNTHESIS=1
IRODORI_SYNTHESIS_WAIT_TIMEOUT=300
```

If the model is still loading or no synthesis slot becomes available before the configured timeout, the server returns HTTP 503.

## Configuration

Server defaults are configured with environment variables. For local runs and Docker Compose, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit it as needed.

All environment variables use the `IRODORI_` prefix. Request fields override these defaults when the corresponding option is provided in the API request.

- PyTorch 2.10.0+cu130
- Python 3.10

This branch uses:

https://github.com/tinatsu-nomy/Irodori-TTS/tree/aarch64

The underlying Irodori-TTS aarch64 branch disables TorchCodec and uses
the SoundFile fallback for audio I/O.

Currently verified:

- VoiceDesign
- Multiple Reference Clips
- OpenAI-compatible `/v1/audio/speech`
- Docker GPU execution

Other features have not yet been validated on aarch64.

### DGX Spark note
